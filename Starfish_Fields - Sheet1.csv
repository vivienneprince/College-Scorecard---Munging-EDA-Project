Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. This metric is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate divided by the number of full-time, first-time, undergraduates in the corresponding completion rate cohort (D100_4, D100_L4). For full-time, first-time, bachelor's degree-seeking undergraduates, 100 percent of normal time is typically 4 years, and for full-time, first-time, associate's degree-seeking undergraduates it is typically 2 years. For full-time, first-time, certificate-seeking undergraduates, the normal time period varies by the length of the program (for example, 6 months for a certificate with a normal completion time of 6 months). Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent."
